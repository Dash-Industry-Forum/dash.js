# Monthly Call

We have decided to have a monthly call to coordinate all the ongoing activities in dash.js and highlight potential
features and issues which are relevant for the upcoming sprints. The monthly call is scheduled for every third Tuesday
of a month.

The schedule of the dash.js monthly call can be found in the [SVTA calendar](https://www.svta.org/svta-calendar/).
