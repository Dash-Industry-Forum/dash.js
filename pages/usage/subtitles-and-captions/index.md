# Subtitles & Captions

dash.js has support for multiple subtitling and captioning formats including VTT captions, embedded CEA 608/708
captions, and TTML EBU timed text tracks.
Additionally, dash.js has a mechanism for consuming subtitle events so subtitles can be rendered separately, outside of
dash.js.

Multiple samples demonstrating subtitle handling in dash.js can be found in
our [sample section](https://reference.dashif.org/dash.js/nightly/samples/index.html#SubtitlesandCaptions). For more
detailed usage instructions check the links below:
