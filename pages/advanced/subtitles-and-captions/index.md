# Subtitles & Captions

dash.js has support for multiple subtitling and captioning formats including VTT captions, embedded CEA 608/708 captions, and TTML EBU timed text tracks.
Additionally, dash.js has a mechanism for consuming subtitle events so subtitles can be rendered separately, outside of dash.js.
