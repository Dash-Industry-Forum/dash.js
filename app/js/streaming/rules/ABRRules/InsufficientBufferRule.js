     * This rule is intended to be sure that our buffer doesn't run dry.
     * If the buffer runs dry playback halts until more data is downloaded.
     * The buffer will run dry when the fragments are taking too long to download.
     * The player may have sufficient bandwidth to download a fragment is a reasonable time,
     * but the play may not leave enough time in the buffer to allow for longer fragments.
     * A dry buffer is a good indication of this use case, so we want to switch down to
     * smaller fragments to decrease download time.
     *
     * TODO
     * An alternative would be to increase the size of the buffer.
     * Is there a good way to handle this?
     * Maybe the BufferExtensions should have some monitoring built into the
     * shouldBufferMore method to increase the buffer over time...
