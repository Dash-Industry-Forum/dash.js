/**
 * @typedef {Object} AbrSettings
 * @property {string} [movingAverageMethod="slidingWindow"]
 * Sets the moving average method used for smoothing throughput estimates. Valid methods are
 * "slidingWindow" and "ewma". The call has no effect if an invalid method is passed.
 *
 * The sliding window moving average method computes the average throughput using the last four segments downloaded.
 * If the stream is live (as opposed to VOD), then only the last three segments are used.
 * If wide variations in throughput are detected, the number of segments can be dynamically increased to avoid oscillations.
 *
 * The exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) method computes the average using exponential smoothing.
 * Two separate estimates are maintained, a fast one with a three-second half life and a slow one with an eight-second half life.
 * The throughput estimate at any time is the minimum of the fast and slow estimates.
 * This allows a fast reaction to a bandwidth drop and prevents oscillations on bandwidth spikes.
 * @property {string} [ABRStrategy="abrDynamic"] Returns the current ABR strategy being used: "abrDynamic", "abrBola" or "abrThroughput".
 * @property {number} [bandwidthSafetyFactor=0.9]
 * Standard ABR throughput rules multiply the throughput by this value. It should be between 0 and 1,
 * with lower values giving less rebuffering (but also lower quality).
 * @property {boolean} [useDefaultABRRules=true] Should the default ABR rules be used, or the custom ones added.
 * @property {boolean} [useBufferOccupancyABR=false] Whether to use the BOLA abr rule.
 * @property {boolean} [useDeadTimeLatency=true]
 * If true, only the download portion will be considered part of the download bitrate
 * and latency will be regarded as static. If false, the reciprocal of the whole
 * transfer time will be used.
 * @property {boolean} [limitBitrateByPortal=false] If true, the size of the video portal will limit the max chosen video resolution.
 * @property {boolean} [usePixelRatioInLimitBitrateByPortal=false]
 * Sets whether to take into account the device's pixel ratio when defining the portal dimensions.
 * Useful on, for example, retina displays.
 * @property {module:Settings~AudioVideoSettings} [maxBitrate={audio: -1, video: -1}] The maximum bitrate that the ABR algorithms will choose. Use NaN for no limit.
 * @property {module:Settings~AudioVideoSettings} [minBitrate={audio: -1, video: -1}] The minimum bitrate that the ABR algorithms will choose. Use NaN for no limit.
 * @property {module:Settings~AudioVideoSettings} [maxRepresentationRatio={audio: 1, video: 1}]
 * When switching multi-bitrate content (auto or manual mode) this property specifies the maximum representation allowed,
 * as a proportion of the size of the representation set.
 *
 * You can set or remove this cap at anytime before or during playback. To clear this setting you set the value to 1.
 *
 * If both this and maxAllowedBitrate are defined, maxAllowedBitrate is evaluated first, then maxAllowedRepresentation,
 * i.e. the lowest value from executing these rules is used.
 *
 * This feature is typically used to reserve higher representations for playback only when connected over a fast connection.
 * @property {module:Settings~AudioVideoSettings} [initialBitrate={audio: -1, video: -1}] Explicitly set the starting bitrate for audio or video
 * @property {module:Settings~AudioVideoSettings} [initialRepresentationRatio={audio: -1, video: -1}] Explicitly set the initial representation ratio. If initalBitrate is specified, this is ignored.
 * @property {module:Settings~AudioVideoSettings} [autoSwitchBitrate={audio: true, video: true}] Indicates whether the player should enable ABR algorithms to switch the bitrate.
 */

/**
 * @typedef {Object} StreamingSettings
 * @property {number} [metricsMaxListDepth=1000] Maximum list depth of metrics.
 * @property {number} [abandonLoadTimeout=10000]
 * A timeout value in seconds, which during the ABRController will block switch-up events.
 * This will only take effect after an abandoned fragment event occurs.
 * @property {number} [liveDelayFragmentCount=4]
 * Changing this value will lower or increase live stream latency.  The detected segment duration will be multiplied by this value
 * to define a time in seconds to delay a live stream from the live edge. Lowering this value will lower latency but may decrease
 * the player's ability to build a stable buffer.
 * @property {number} [liveDelay]
 * <p>Equivalent in seconds of setLiveDelayFragmentCount</p>
 * <p>Lowering this value will lower latency but may decrease the player's ability to build a stable buffer.</p>
 * <p>This value should be less than the manifest duration by a couple of segment durations to avoid playback issues</p>
 * <p>If set, this parameter will take precedence over setLiveDelayFragmentCount and manifest info</p>
 * @property {boolean} [scheduleWhilePaused=true]
 * Set to true if you would like dash.js to keep downloading fragments in the background
 * when the video element is paused.
 * @property {boolean} [fastSwitchEnabled=false]
 * When enabled, after an ABR up-switch in quality, instead of requesting and appending the next fragment
 * at the end of the current buffer range it is requested and appended closer to the current time
 * When enabled, The maximum time to render a higher quality is current time + (1.5 * fragment duration).
 *
 * Note, When ABR down-switch is detected, we appended the lower quality at the end of the buffer range to preserve the
 * higher quality media for as long as possible.
 *
 * If enabled, it should be noted there are a few cases when the client will not replace inside buffer range but rather
 * just append at the end.  1. When the buffer level is less than one fragment duration 2.  The client
 * is in an Abandonment State due to recent fragment abandonment event.
 *
 * Known issues:
 * 1. In IE11 with auto switching off, if a user switches to a quality they can not download in time the
 * fragment may be appended in the same range as the playhead or even in the past, in IE11 it may cause a stutter
 * or stall in playback.
 * @property {number} [bufferPruningInterval=10] The interval of pruning buffer in sconds.
 * @property {number} [bufferToKeep=20]
 * This value influences the buffer pruning logic.
 * Allows you to modify the buffer that is kept in source buffer in seconds.
 *  0|-----------bufferToPrune-----------|-----bufferToKeep-----|currentTime|
 * @property {number} [bufferAheadToKeep=80]
 * This value influences the buffer pruning logic.
 * Allows you to modify the buffer ahead of current time position that is kept in source buffer in seconds.
 * <pre>0|--------|currentTime|-----bufferAheadToKeep----|----bufferToPrune-----------|end|</pre>
 * @property {boolean} [jumpGaps=true] Sets whether player should jump small gaps (discontinuities) in the buffer.
 * @property {number} [smallGapLimit=1.8] Time in seconds for a gap to be considered small.
 * @property {number} [stableBufferTime=12]
 * The time that the internal buffer target will be set to post startup/seeks (NOT top quality).
 *
 * When the time is set higher than the default you will have to wait longer
 * to see automatic bitrate switches but will have a larger buffer which
 * will increase stability.
 * @property {number} [bufferTimeAtTopQuality=30]
 * The time that the internal buffer target will be set to once playing the top quality.
 * If there are multiple bitrates in your adaptation, and the media is playing at the highest
 * bitrate, then we try to build a larger buffer at the top quality to increase stability
 * and to maintain media quality.
 * @property {number} [bufferTimeAtTopQualityLongForm=60] The time that the internal buffer target will be set to once playing the top quality for long form content.
 * @property {number} [longFormContentDurationThreshold=600]
 * The threshold which defines if the media is considered long form content.
 * This will directly affect the buffer targets when playing back at the top quality.
 * @property {number} [wallclockTimeUpdateInterval=50] How frequently the wallclockTimeUpdated internal event is triggered (in milliseconds).
 * @property {boolean} [lowLatencyEnabled=false] Enable or disable low latency mode
 * @property {boolean} [keepProtectionMediaKeys=false]
 * Set the value for the ProtectionController and MediaKeys life cycle. If true, the
 * ProtectionController and then created MediaKeys and MediaKeySessions will be preserved during
 * the MediaPlayer lifetime.
 * @property {boolean} [useManifestDateHeaderTimeSource=true]
 * <p>Allows you to enable the use of the Date Header, if exposed with CORS, as a timing source for live edge detection. The
 * use of the date header will happen only after the other timing source that take precedence fail or are omitted as described.
 * @property {boolean} [useSuggestedPresentationDelay=false]
 * <p>Set to true if you would like to override the default live delay and honor the SuggestedPresentationDelay attribute in by the manifest.</p>
 * @property {boolean} [useAppendWindowEnd=true]
 * Specifies if the appendWindowEnd attribute of the MSE SourceBuffers should be set according to content duration from manifest.
 * @property {number} [manifestUpdateRetryInterval=100]
 * For live streams, set the interval-frequency in milliseconds at which
 * dash.js will check if the current manifest is still processed before
 * downloading the next manifest once the minimumUpdatePeriod time has
 * @property {number} [liveCatchUpMinDrift=0.02]
 * Use this method to set the minimum latency deviation allowed before activating catch-up mechanism. In low latency mode,
 * when the difference between the measured latency and the target one,
 * as an absolute number, is higher than the one sets with this method, then dash.js increases/decreases
 * playback rate until target latency is reached.
 *
 * LowLatencyMinDrift should be provided in seconds, and it uses values between 0.0 and 0.5.
 *
 * Note: Catch-up mechanism is only applied when playing low latency live streams.
 * @property {number} [liveCatchUpMaxDrift=0]
 * Use this method to set the maximum latency deviation allowed before dash.js to do a seeking to live position. In low latency mode,
 * when the difference between the measured latency and the target one,
 * as an absolute number, is higher than the one sets with this method, then dash.js does a seek to live edge position minus
 * the target live delay.
 *
 * LowLatencyMaxDriftBeforeSeeking should be provided in seconds. If 0, then seeking operations won't be used for
 * fixing latency deviations.
 *
 * Note: Catch-up mechanism is only applied when playing low latency live streams.
 * @property {number} [liveCatchUpPlaybackRate=0.5]
 * Use this method to set the maximum catch up rate, as a percentage, for low latency live streams. In low latency mode,
 * when measured latency is higher/lower than the target one,
 * dash.js increases/decreases playback rate respectively up to (+/-) the percentage defined with this method until target is reached.
 *
 * Valid values for catch up rate are in range 0-0.5 (0-50%). Set it to 0 to turn off live catch up feature.
 *
 * Note: Catch-up mechanism is only applied when playing low latency live streams.
 * @property {module:Settings~CachingInfoSettings} [lastBitrateCachingInfo={enabled: true, ttl: 360000}]
 * Set to false if you would like to disable the last known bit rate from being stored during playback and used
 * to set the initial bit rate for subsequent playback within the expiration window.
 *
 * The default expiration is one hour, defined in milliseconds. If expired, the default initial bit rate (closest to 1000 kbps) will be used
 * for that session and a new bit rate will be stored during that session.
 * @property {module:Settings~CachingInfoSettings} [lastMediaSettingsCachingInfo={enabled: true, ttl: 360000}]
 * Set to false if you would like to disable the last known lang for audio (or camera angle for video) from being stored during playback and used
 * to set the initial settings for subsequent playback within the expiration window.
 *
 * The default expiration is one hour, defined in milliseconds. If expired, the default settings will be used
 * for that session and a new settings will be stored during that session.
 * @property {module:Settings~AudioVideoSettings} [cacheLoadThresholds={video: 50, audio: 5}]
 * For a given media type, the threshold which defines if the response to a fragment
 * request is coming from browser cache or not.
 * @property {module:Settings~RequestTypeSettings} [retryIntervals] Time in milliseconds of which to reload a failed file load attempt.
