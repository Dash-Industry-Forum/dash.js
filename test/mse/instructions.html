    <h3>You can use &uarr;&darr;&rarr;&larr; to move around and use ENTER to
      select.</h3>
    <h3>You can increase the test timeout or <a href="download.tar.gz"> download
    </a> the test package and host it locally to avoid any issues caused by
    bandwidth and latency. However, the XHRAbort test is independent to network
    condition and should pass when running from the remote server.</h3>
    <h3>You can add GET parameters to <a href="main.html">main.html</a> to alter
      the way the tests runs.</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Use
        <span class='code'>
          <a href="main.html?command=run">
            main.html?command=run</a>
        </span> to run all tests.
      </li>
      <li>Use
        <span class='code'>
          <a href="main.html?view_type=full">
            main.html?view_type=full</a>
        </span> to show full view, which has controls for individual test
        and is useful on PC.
      </li>
      <li>Use
        <span class='code'>
          <a href="main.html?tests=1,2,5,10">
            main.html?tests=1,2,5,10
          </a>
        </span> to select tests 1, 2, 5 and 10.
      </li>
      <li>Use
        <span class='code'>
          <a href="main.html?exclude=2,5,8">
            main.html?exclude=2,5,8
          </a>
        </span> to exclude tests 2, 5 and 8.
      </li>
      <li>Use
        <span class='code'>
          <a href="main.html?loop=true">
            main.html?loop=true</a>
        </span> to turn on loop.
      </li>
      <li>Use
        <span class='code'>
          <a href="main.html?stoponfailure=true">
            main.html?stoponfailure=true</a>
        </span> to turn on stoponfailure.
      </li>
      <li>Use
        <span class='code'>
          <a href="main.html?disable_log=true">
            main.html?disable_log=true
          </a>
        </span> to disable log.
      </li>
      <li>Use
        <span class='code'>
          <a href="main.html?timeout=60000">
            main.html?timeout=60000
          </a>
        </span> to set timeout to 60000ms. By default timeout is 30000.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Note: Most of these parameters can be combined. So
      <span class="code">
        <a
          href="main.html?command=run&tests_mask=10101&stoponfailure=true</span">
          main.html?command=run&tests_mask=10101&stoponfailure=true</a></span>
      will run tests 1, 3 and 5 automatically and stop on the first failure.
