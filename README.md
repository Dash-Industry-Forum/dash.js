If your intent is to use the player code without contributing back to this project, then use the MASTER branch which holds the approved and stable public releases. 

If your goal is to improve or extend the code and contribute back to this project, then you should fork the DEVELOPMENT branch. Read through our wiki section on https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js/wiki/How-to-Contribute for a walk-through of the contribution process.
